# üëã Hi! I'm Marcos

![Stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=marcosrg9&show_icons=true)

I am a web developer, specifically fullstack.
In addition to that, I am a student of network administration.

I usually work with MEAN stack technologies, although I also have experience with the LAMP stack.

## ü¶Ñ What I'm best at doing

![Angular](https://img.shields.io/badge/Angular-DD0031?style=for-the-badge&logo=angular&logoColor=white)
![Express](https://img.shields.io/badge/Express.js-FFFFFF?style=for-the-badge&logo=express&logoColor=black)
![SocketIO](https://img.shields.io/badge/Socket.io-010101?&style=for-the-badge&logo=Socket.io&logoColor=white)
![Electron](https://img.shields.io/badge/Electron-2B2E3A?style=for-the-badge&logo=electron&logoColor=9FEAF9)

I love NodeJS, it provides me with all the tools I need to do as far as my imagination can go, and I am fully confident that it is one of the runtimes with the most possibilities.

Angular is amazing, since version 11 I've been learning very interesting things, and the change detector is the best ü§§.

Express captivated me from the first time I used it, the elegance and organization to manage routes, middlewares and controllers I love.

Socket.IO is great (and websockets in general), it just looks like magic, I find fascinating the possibility of establishing ambidirectional communications without polling...

And finally, Electron, the icing on the cake. The ability to port all my work to desktop applications with the interface I have designed makes me even more motivated to continue in this world.

## üëå Languages I master very well

![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/TypeScript-007ACC?style=for-the-badge&logo=typescript&logoColor=white)
![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-F7DF1E?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=black)
![HTML](https://img.shields.io/badge/HTML5-E34F26?style=for-the-badge&logo=html5&logoColor=white)
![CSS](https://img.shields.io/badge/CSS3-1572B6?style=for-the-badge&logo=css3&logoColor=white)

From the first moment I started using Angular, I had to learn TypeScript by force, at first I did not even think of using it in the backend, but as I learned to use it (and I fought with the declaration merging) I realized how powerful it was, when I had more confidence, I thought of using it also in the backend, since then most of the projects I start, are in TypeScript.
